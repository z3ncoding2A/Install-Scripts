Guidelines for Arch post installation


log in as root

useradd -m your-user-name

passwd your-user-name

vim /etc/sudoers

copy line where root has ALL ALL

paste it and change the word root to your user name and save the file

logout and login with your new user name

mkdir .config

You can install your favourite desktop or window manager, and apps or you can download my configs and install
my favourites. I have a basic script called autoapp, which installs most apps one would need. I also
have a runconfig file which copies certain files into the proper place.

Get my config files below

git clone https://gitlab.com/artibus1/mench.git

cd into the mench folder and then into the arch folder

run the  autoapp install script by typing:  ./autoapp.sh

run  my config script by typing:  ./runconfigs.sh

reboot

log in to awesome, qtile, or cinnamon 

awesome & qtile are configured and themed, cinnamon is not, you have to do it yourself. 
Cinnamon is easy and I have several videos showing how I like it.

in the terminal type: zsh and su into root and type zsh

if zsh is working with my config, you can make it the default shell, if you want to

sudo vim /etc/passwd

on the first line that starts with root, at the end of the line delete bash and type zsh

find the line with your user name, at the end of the line delete bash and type zsh

be carefull when in the passwd file, if you accidently, mess something up, you may not be 
able to boot in to your system or your passwords may not work. If this happens there is a way 
to fix it but it's too complicated to explain by typing it here

reboot

Good Luck!


THE END
