Guidelines for installing Arch Linux WITH  Encryption the manual way


If you have never done this before, you should watch one of my Arch Base Install Videos before trying this and 
it would be wise to try it on an extra computer or a vitural machine.

You need to know how to use Vim or Nano

Optional, to make tty font larger:  setfont ter-128b or ter-132b

timedatectl set-ntp true

curl -o /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all/

vim /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist  (select a few mirrors from your country)

pacman -Syy

vim /etc/pacman.conf    (uncomment verbose & parallel downloads)

cfdisk   delete partitions until the disk is all free space   

make boot partition 200M, make main partition for the rest of your drive should be G, example: 500G

lsblk   to see what your drives are called

cryptsetup -y -v luksFormat /dev/sda2

cryptsetup open /dev/sda2 me   (drive doesn't have to be called me. You can use any name)

mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/me

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1

lsblk

mount /dev/mapper/me /mnt

mkdir /mnt/boot

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot

lsblk    just to see your drives are okay

if you want the long the term support kernel, type linux-lts instead of linux in the line below

pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux linux-firmware linux-headers vim git terminus-font
 
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

arch-chroot /mnt

to find out your zone info type:   ls /usr/share/zoneinfo
                                   ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/Canada
                                   ls /usr/share/zoneinfo/Canada/Eastern

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Canada/Eastern /etc/localtime

YOU CAN DO THE ABOVE INSTEAD OF THE LINE BELOW

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime

vim /etc/locale.gen

locale-gen

vim /etc/locale.conf

LANG=en_CA.UTF-8     make sure you use the correct one for you

vim /etc/hostname    give your computer a host name

passwd root          give root a password

pacman -S networkmanager grub 

systemctl enable NetworkManager     make sure the N and M are capitalized

grub-install /dev/sda

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

vim /etc/mkinitcpio.conf

go to hooks line and between the words block and filesystems insert the word encrypt and save the file

mkinitcpio -P

blkid    you can copy the sda2 UUID number and type it in the grub file or follow the command below

blkid | tee -a uuid

vim in to the file and yy the sda2 line

vim /etc/default/grub

go to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=

and paste the line in, you will have to delete some stuff that was pasted in.

it should look like this with a different uuid number and a different name for your encrypted drive

if this line below is not correct, you won't be able to boot in to the system

GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="cryptdevice=UUID=afedb6e0-c57c-407a-9561-96ceeb2b2c33:cryptme me=/dev/mapper/me"

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

exit

umount -R /mnt

reboot

Remember at this point you only have a root account with a password. You have to make a user with a password and sudo rights. 
You also have to install a Desktop or Window Manager with your favourite apps. See my post install videos or my post install
written instructions


to change encryption password:   cryptsetup luksChangeKey /dev/sda2

to test new password:            cryptsetup --verbose open --test-passphrase /dev/sda2

Good Luck!

THE END
