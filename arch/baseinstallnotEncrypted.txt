Guidelines for installing Arch Linux -- NOT --  Encrypted the manual way

If you have never done this before, you should watch one of my Arch Base Install Videos before trying this and 
it would be wise to try it on an extra computer or a vitural machine.

You need to know how to use Vim or Nano

make tty font large, optional:  setfont ter-128b or ter-132b

timedatectl set-ntp true
timedatectl set-timezone America/Los_Angeles

#curl -o /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist https://archlinux.org/mirrorlist/all/
#vim /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist  (select a few mirrors from your country)
rm -rf /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
touch /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
echo 'Server = https://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch' > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist
echo 'Server = http://mirrors.ocf.berkeley.edu/archlinux/$repo/os/$arch' >> /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist


pacman -Syy

nano /etc/pacman.conf    (uncomment verbose & parallel downloads)

fdisk /dev/sda

lsblk   to see what your drives are called

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda1

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sda2

mount /dev/sda2 /mnt

mkdir /mnt/boot

mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/boot

lsblk   just to see your drives are okay

if you want the long the term support kernel, type linux-lts instead of linux in the line below

pacstrap /mnt base base-devel linux-lts linux-firmware linux-lts-headers nano git dkms broadcom-wl-dkms 
 
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab

arch-chroot /mnt

to find out your Region/City you can type:  timedatectl list-timezones | less

ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime

vim /etc/locale.gen

locale-gen

vim /etc/locale.conf

LANG=en_CA.UTF-8     make sure you use the correct one for you

vim /etc/hostname    give your computer a host name

mkinitcpio -P

passwd root   give root a password

pacman -S networkmanager grub 

systemctl enable NetworkManager     make sure the N and M are capitalized

grub-install /dev/sda

grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

exit

umount -R /mnt

reboot
